This project highlights the use of Dynamic Memory Allocation. The program will take the first line 
of the input fil as n possible ingredients for smoothies and the next n lines will contain
all n possible ingredients that the smoothies will need. The next line contains the x number
of different smoothie recipies, with the next x lines containing smoothie recipes per a line. 
The recipes are formated as the number of ingredients, then the ingredient number followed by its ratio
in the smoothie, and this continues for each ingredient in the smoothie. The next line will contain an integer y 
which represents the number of stores making orders for smoothie ingredients with the last k lines containing each
store's order, an order per a line. The syntax of this line is the r number of different smoothies the store
offers, then each smoothie number and their weight sold in pounts.

The output file of this projects gives the store number and the list of each ingredient and the weight
the is needed for each ingredient.
